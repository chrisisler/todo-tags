# Todo Tags

> Todo app with tagging.

Built using [Next](nextjs.org).

## Dev

```sh
yarn dev

# Then `localhost:3000` in your browser.
```

## To do

- `actions.todos.tags.add` (and `actions.todos.doubleClicked` ref usage?)
- Write tests

## Learned

- The `<label>` html tag exists
- CSS is hard (duh)
- CSS duplication can be overdone and underutilized (tough balance)
- Couldn't easily find way to share state between nextjs pages.
